#Representational state transfer (REST) => is a software architectual style that defines a set constraints to be used for creating Web services.

Form_For - an advanced form helper that will yield a FormBuilder object that you use to generate your form element (text fields, labels, a submit button, etc)
    => works best for forms that manage CRUD
Form_Tag - an lower-level form helper that simply generates a form element. To add fields to the form tag block, you add form elements tags (text_field_tag, number field tag, submit tag, etc)
    => works well for forms that are not directly connected with models (search engines)

Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY)
    => DRY is a software design principle that, like Seperate of Concerns, helps make decisions about how to organize code.

Helpers are methods that are available to views and encapsulates a common bit of code

find => raises RecordNotFound Exception when returns nil 
find_by => returns nil without exceptions

<div> defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
